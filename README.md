Welcome to the Dart and Flutter Essentials repository! This collection covers various fundamental concepts and features of the Dart programming language, essential for anyone looking to master Flutter development.

## Dart

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

This includes all the necessary concepts of Dart Programming language which are essential for Flutter Developers.
